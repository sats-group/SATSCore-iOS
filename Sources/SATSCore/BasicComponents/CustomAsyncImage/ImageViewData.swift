/** A generic way to represent Image values.

 When fetching records from a backend, images are usually returned as `URL` types.
 This means we cannot simply pass that `URL` to the view, because the view
 end up with logic and state, which is something we want to avoid.

 Then as a solution for this, we can express that "image" concept as
 `ImageViewData`, this can be rendered with state in a controlled
 manner by `CustomAsyncImage`, **But we also have the ability to directly pass an image to a view**
 making it easier to test/develop in isolation.

 The idea is whenever we have a URL that is a representation of an image,
 we pass `remote(url)` to the view data values.
